            <p>
                Norgen Biotek, established in 1998 by Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad, is nestled within Thorold, Ontario, just a stone's throw from Brock University. 
                
                This biotech enterprise, spread across a 24,000 square-foot advanced facility, has garnered recognition in the form of ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and ISO 15189 certifications. 
                
                Their expertise lies in sample collection, preparation, and detection, with a commitment to unparalleled quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                With over thirty-five patents under their belt, Norgen's unique platform technology revolves around a proprietary resin/matrix. 
                
                This innovation aids in purifying and concentrating DNA, RNA, microRNA, proteins, and exosomes across various sample types. 
                
                Such advancements in purification are pivotal for diagnostics and numerous molecular biological applications, earning Norgen the esteemed "Innovation Leader Award for 2003" by the National Research Council.
            </p>
            <p>
                Norgenâ€™s prowess extends to developing and manufacturing a plethora of products, from isolation kits to sample collection devices.

                They champion the cause of quality and consistency, with all products adhering to the ISO 13485:2016 standard, ensuring cGMP compliance.

                Their commitment to quality is reflected not only in their products but also in their contract manufacturing services, tailored to individual requirements, ensuring timely deliveries and unmatched services.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Norgen develops a lot of RNA sequencing kits as well as sample purification services, they recently opened and started a bioinformatics department.

                I worked in this "recently started" bioinformatics department, which comprised of five powerful linux machines that are heavily customized to suit the bioinformatics department's various computing needs.

                My work involved a lot of development operations work (especially whenever docker was concerned) as well various linux system administration responsibilities.

                I will delve deeper into the work that I completed while at Norgen Biotek later on in this report.

            <!-- Learning Goal 1 -->
            <h4>Learning Goal 1</h4>
            <p>To develop my ability to solve problems in the bioinformatics field that arise due to the interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics.</p>
            <h5>Action Plan 1</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Continue working on creating reproducible, portable, and version-controlled Docker images for the various bioinformatics tools on my employer's bioinformatics machines.</li>
                <li>Continue working with different bioinformatics tools that are available and used on my employer's machines.</li>
                <li>Work with Bash, Python, and R scripts to make the bioinformatics tools in my bioinformatics pipelines easier to integrate and use.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Measure of Success 1</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>By successfully creating the Docker images for the various bioinformatics pipelines, I will have completed the first step in my action plan.</li>
                <li>By using bioinformatics tools like 'exceRpt' and 'mothur' during my work-term, I would have completed the second step in my action plan.</li>
                <li>By modifying the Bash, Python, and R scripts to improve the usability and integration of my bioinformatics tools, I would have completed the third step in my action plan.</li>
                <li>By completing all of these three steps, then I will have achieved my learning goal of developing my ability to solve problems in the bioinformatics field.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Reflection 1</h5>
            <p>
                I have achieved my goal of developing my ability to solve problems in bioinformatics contexts by successfully developing the docker images for the 'exceRpt' and 'sRNAbench' pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                By developing the 'sRNAbench' and 'exceRpt' docker images, I have been exposed to using a wide variety of bioinformatics tools (like 'STAR', 'bowtie', 'samtools', 'cutadapt', and 'sratoolkit') and have had to figure out how to integrate them together in my Docker images. 
                
                This process allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how the different bioinformatics tools work, which has improved my ability to think critically through the problems that can arise when using bioinformatics tools.
                
                I did fairly well in developing and improving the bash and python scripts, but not so much on the R side of things. 
                
                The bash scripts were improved and I learned a decent amount about bash scripting through doing so. 
                
                While there were not many python scripts in 'exceRpt', there were a few in 'sRNAbench' that I worked with. 
                
                I made some improvements, but ran into a few smaller and unexpected difficulties with the refactored python scripts that I did not get the time to figure out. 
                
                The R scripts were challenging, but I was able to make them work in my Docker image.
