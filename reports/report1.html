                Norgen Biotek, established in 1998 by Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad, is nestled within Thorold, Ontario, just a stone's throw from Brock University. 
                
                This biotech enterprise, spread across a 24,000 square-foot advanced facility, has garnered recognition in the form of ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and ISO 15189 certifications. 
                
                Their expertise lies in sample collection, preparation, and detection, with a commitment to unparalleled quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                With over thirty-five patents under their belt, Norgen's unique platform technology revolves around a proprietary resin/matrix. 
                
                This innovation aids in purifying and concentrating DNA, RNA, microRNA, proteins, and exosomes across various sample types. 
                
                Such advancements in purification are pivotal for diagnostics and numerous molecular biological applications, earning Norgen the esteemed "Innovation Leader Award for 2003" by the National Research Council.
            </p>
            <p>
                Norgenâ€™s prowess extends to developing and manufacturing a plethora of products, from isolation kits to sample collection devices.

                They champion the cause of quality and consistency, with all products adhering to the ISO 13485:2016 standard, ensuring cGMP compliance.

                Their commitment to quality is reflected not only in their products but also in their contract manufacturing services, tailored to individual requirements, ensuring timely deliveries and unmatched services.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Norgen develops a lot of RNA sequencing kits as well as sample purification services, they recently opened and started a bioinformatics department.

                I worked in this "recently started" bioinformatics department, which comprised of five powerful linux machines that are heavily customized to suit the bioinformatics department's various computing needs.

                My work involved a lot of development operations work (especially whenever docker was concerned) as well various linux system administration responsibilities.

                I will delve deeper into the work that I completed while at Norgen Biotek later on in this report.
