			<p>
				The University of Guelph was first established in 1964, but it was not until 1971 that the School of Computer Science (SoCS) (where I worked) was founded. For much of the report, I will be focused on describing SoCS rather than the university as a whole. Nonetheless, the University of Guelph is a research intensive and comprehensive academic institution known for its safe campus, noteworthy presence in various quality science journals, and a relentless focus on student experience.
			</p>

			<p>
				The University of Guelph is, well, in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The closest and most notable road to the University is Stone Road, which itself is a massive road that leads to a variety of interesting landmarks within Guelph (not including the University, of course).
			</p>

			<p>
				Through various means and methods, the University's, and all of the colleges that it collects under its one roof, ultimate mission is: improve life.

			</p>

			<p>
				How the University improves life comes down to its, as mentioned before, its heavy and quality research output and its emphasis on admitting and educating the best students that Canada and the rest of the world have to offer. Many notable Professors work in the university's various colleges, and many more have an impressive research track record. As for students, look no further than the quality and diverse array of the University's alumni crop to see them working on some of the most exciting and challenging academic and industrial fields in the current world. For instance: Doctor Stefan Kremer is a renowned machine learning expert, and his research into machine learning itself and its practical applications in solving difficult enviromental challenges is well documented. In-fact, Doctor Kremer is a University of Guelph alumni, as he did his undergraduate degree in computer science and then went on to obtain his PhD in computer science at the University of Alberta. He now teaches and performs research in the field of machine learning in the School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph.
			</p>

			<p>
				On the academic side, the University earns the right to be labeled as a "comprehensive" university because it houses several academic departments. For instance: the University houses the following great departments: a Psychology department, a Social Sciences department, a Music and Arts department, an Engineering department that houses a wide array of engineering disciplines, a Computer Science department, an Agriculture department, and, finally, a Veterinary School.
			</p>

			<p>
				The School of Computing itself is home to six main branches of computer science research: machine learning, bioinformatics, education, cyber-security, human computer interaction (HCI), and theoretical computer science. My supervisor's, Doctor Yan Yan, primary area of research was bioinformatics, and especially the usage of machine learning to solve complicated and difficult bioinformatics problems. Working in bioinformatics was not novel to me; I worked in an industry position as a first-time co-op student in the summer of 2023 for Norgen Biotek Corporation, but the problems that I solved and the tools that I learned to solve them during my stint as a research assistant to Dr. Yan were novel, interesting, and quite challenging to me. We primarily worked on finding better alternatives and solutions to performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using machine learning as the main toolkit to do so (more on this later).
			</p>

			<p>
				While the research intensity of the SoCS department cannot be understated, its teaching prowess is nothing to scoff at. Considering the quantity and quality of the students that learn under the roof and guidance of SoCS, it remains an impressive feat just how effective and efficient the SoCS department is at producing a sublime crop of students that come through its doors. The SoCS department is also home to the excellent SoCS co-operative education department, which handles the co-op needs of computer science students. While the co-op department is, technically, a smaller and a sub-department of the SoCS, its influence is nothing short of incredible. Many students who are registered in the co-op program while doing their undergraduate degree in computing at the University end up being matched with some of the finest and most noteworthy employers in Canada (some even end up working for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft). I personally know of a decent amount of co-op students in the computer science program who are working for Canada's largest banks, namely: the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and the Toronto-Dominion Bank Group (TD Bank).

			<h2>Information about the project</h2>
			<p>
				The research project that I worked on with my supervisor, Doctor Yan, was developing a user-friendly, command-line interface (CLI) pipeline for combining traditional GWAS tools (such as GAPIT, TASSEL, and PLINK) with an existing machine learning toolkit specifically designed for GWAS work.

			</p>

			<p>
				The specific machine learning (ML) toolkit that we used and worked on was 'PentaPen'. 'PentaPen' was a machine learning toolkit developed by Nikita Kohli as part of her Master's thesis in data science when she was a student at Thompson Rivers University. The ML toolkit was specifically designed to work with GWAS data, and its development was finished over a few months ago. We inherited this ML toolkit because: according to the Kohli and colleagues (2024) conference paper on the specifics of 'PentaPen', the benefits and precision of using ML tools to perform GWAS work are impossible to deny. Given the importance of the role that GWAS plays in the field of genomic research, especially in the contemporary bioinformatics world with the prevalence of computational methods for finding relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in extremely large genomes., finding and developing better ways of performing GWAS is a key and active area of research in bioinformatics.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal, from the outset, was to combine and simplify the usage of traditional GWAS tools with contemporary and effective ML tools. The means of getting to this goal were defined from the outset when I began working on the project: to use docker, the excellent Golang programming language, and the superb Cobra CLI library to build the best possible CLI interface for this proposed pipeline. The end-goal was to have a working prototype that allows the user, with minimal configuration and installation, to easily run any type of GWAS analysis on their genomic and phenotype input data using the CLI. The results that the user would receive as output from the system would be a collection of identified SNPs that the user would then use as key markers for future genomic research. Some applications of the output that our proposed pipeline would have produced would centre on: biomedical engineering, gene therapy research, and genomic research. Much of the work that our proposed pipeline does is aimed at making the task of finding critical regions of the genome as easy and as feasible as possible.
			</p>

			<p>
				While the theoretical foundation of the work was rock solid, the issues with the existing 'PentaPen' codebase were numerous and very challenging. The issues made it impossible to integrate the 'PentaPen' ML toolkit into a singular, cohesive CLI pipeline, as described earlier. The 'PentaPen' ML toolkit, as a result, required a ton of bug fixes and refactoring to become somewhat stable and usable. Basically, and due to the proliferation of integration and usability issues with the existing 'PentaPen' ML toolkit that we inherited for this project, we spent the vast majority of the project's development testing, finding bugs and defects, and fixing said bugs and defects as they appeared. While the end-result was very promising (and at-least usable): we did manage to get the 'PentaPen' ML toolkit to become much more stable and easier-to-use than when we first inherited and used it, but it still had a small amount of fatal bugs and code defects that made the only remaining two machine learning methods unusable (for context: we got three out of five machine learning models working flawlessly with real-world genomic and phenotype data).
			</p>

			<p>
				At the end of my work-term, myself and Dr. Yan decided to cease work on fixing and testing the 'PentaPen' ML toolkit, and to shift our development resources into researching and integrating existing useful deep-learning methods as a replacement for the 'PentaPen' ML toolkit. The focus of the research project is still the same as before; the only change was we now had to work on finding a suitable deep-learning model for performing GWAS in parallel to the established GWAS tools. Once a deep-learning model is found (which we are very close to doing, as of the time of writing and publishing this report) found, we will integrate it into our existing ecosystem for the Cobra-based CLI pipeline.
